# üöÄ Trans-Tokenization and Fine-Tuning with ZenML

Welcome to the repository where we combine the power of trans-tokenization and fine-tuning to create a highly efficient and multilingual large language model (LLM). This README will guide you through the process of setting up your environment, running the trans-tokenization process, and fine-tuning the model using CNCF tools like ZenML.

## üéØ Goal

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how trans-tokenization can be used as a pre-processing step to improve the fine-tuning of LLMs, specifically targeting multilingual models. We will be using the `Meta-Llama-3-8B` model as our base and fine-tuning it for the English-to-Dutch translation task.

## üìö Introduction to Trans-Tokenization

Trans-tokenization is a technique that aligns token embeddings between languages, improving the adaptability of LLMs to new languages and reducing performance gaps, especially in low-resource languages. By initializing the target language‚Äôs token embeddings with semantically similar embeddings from the source language, we can ensure that the model retains contextual meaning across languages.

## üî† Tokenization with SentencePiece and Tiktoken

### SentencePiece
SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for Neural Network-based text generation systems. It uses subword units and allows for handling different languages within a single model.

### Tiktoken
Tiktoken is another tokenizer often used with LLMs like GPT. It handles text as byte-level encoding, making it efficient for handling diverse scripts and languages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- ZenML
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## üßë‚Äçüíª Running Trans-Tokenization

Below is a code snippet that demonstrates how to perform trans-tokenization using the `transtokenizers` package:

```python
from transtokenizers import create_aligned_corpus, align, map_tokens, smooth_mapping, remap_model
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import os

source_model = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"
target_tokenizer = "yhavinga/gpt-neo-1.3B-dutch"
export_dir = "en-nl-llama3-8b"

# Step 1: Create an aligned corpus
corpus = create_aligned_corpus(
    source_language="en",
    target_language="nl",
    source_tokenizer=source_model,
    target_tokenizer=target_tokenizer,
)

# Step 2: Align the corpus
mapped_tokens_file = align(corpus, fast_align_path="fast_align")

# Step 3: Map tokens between source and target
tokenized_possible_translations, untokenized_possible_translations = map_tokens(mapped_tokens_file, source_model, target_tokenizer)

# Step 4: Smooth the mapping
smoothed_mapping = smooth_mapping(target_tokenizer, tokenized_possible_translations)

# Step 5: Remap the model
model = remap_model(source_model, target_tokenizer, smoothed_mapping, source_model)
os.makedirs(export_dir, exist_ok=False)
new_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(target_tokenizer)
model.save_pretrained(export_dir)
new_tokenizer.save_pretrained(export_dir)
```

### How to Use It

1. Run the trans-tokenization process using the provided script.
2. This will create a new tokenizer and model, which can then be fine-tuned using ZenML.

## üîÑ Fine-Tuning with ZenML

ZenML is a cloud-native machine learning tool that simplifies the process of orchestrating and fine-tuning models in a scalable way. Here‚Äôs how to integrate your trans-tokenized model with ZenML for fine-tuning.

### Setting Up ZenML

```bash
pip install zenml
zenml init
```

### Fine-Tuning Workflow

1. **Create a Pipeline**: Define a pipeline in ZenML that includes the steps for loading data, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Integrate the Model**: Use the trans-tokenized model as the base for your fine-tuning pipeline.
3. **Run the Pipeline**: Execute the pipeline on a cloud platform, making use of ZenML‚Äôs orchestration features.

## üìú Sample Fine-Tuning Script

Below is a sample fine-tuning script using Hugging Face‚Äôs `transformers` library and ZenML, inspired by your uploaded script [test.py](58).

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline
from zenml.steps import step

@step
def load_data():
    dataset = load_dataset("zicsx/mC4-Hindi-Cleaned-3.0", split="train")
    return dataset

@step
def tokenize_data(dataset, tokenizer):
    def tokenize_function(examples):
        return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, max_length=256)
    return dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

@pipeline
def finetuning_pipeline(load_data, tokenize_data, train_model):
    dataset = load_data()
    tokenized_dataset = tokenize_data(dataset=dataset)
    train_model(dataset=tokenized_dataset)

# Define steps
load_data = load_data()
tokenize_data = tokenize_data(tokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("en-nl-llama3-8b"))
train_model = Trainer(...)

# Run the pipeline
finetuning_pipeline(load_data=load_data, tokenize_data=tokenize_data, train_model=train_model).run()
```
